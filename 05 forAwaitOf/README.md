# Asynchronous iteration using for-await-of
> The `for-await-of` syntax is similar to the `for-of` iteration. The key difference is that it automatically awaits any promises generated by the iterator. This lesson covers how to consume async data sources easily with `for-await-of`.

***Have the demo window open***
`for-await-of` essentially allows you to use `async/await` with generator function. Lets first look at a simple generator function that returns the first 10 whole numbers. 

* Here we have a simple generator function that returns numbers one by one. 
  * We increment the number and if it becomes more than 10 we stop.
* We can use generator functions in standard synchronous javascript with a simple `main` function
  * and we use `forof` to loop through all the items returned by the numbers function.
  * Then we log out the number
* Lets invoke the main function and observe its behavior

```js
function* numbers() {
  let index = 1;
  while (true) {
    yield index;
    index = index + 1;
    if (index > 10) {
      break;
    }
  }
}

function main() {
  for (const num of numbers()) {
    console.log(num);
  }
}
main();

```

***Run the code***
You can see that it behaves as expected logging out `10` numbers. 

Before the `for await of` JavaScript feature, a generator function could not be async.
