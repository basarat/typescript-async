# Parallel and serial execution using async / await
> The great thing about asynchronous programming is that you can do multiple things in parallel. E.g. you can make multiple network requests, or read multiple files from the file system. This lesson covers how to write parallel as well as serial async code.

# TODO:
- Serial is simple as await as created.
- Parallel is `Promise.all`.
- Also `Promise.race`.
