# `async`/`await` using TypeScript

> Here's a little intro to the course material. I hope you enjoy the course!

***Play a video of the first lesson***
The goal of the `async` `await` using TypeScript course is to help you understand and appreciate how simple asyncronous programing has become thanks to the runtime features provided by JavaScript and the Compile time understanding of your code provided by TypeScript.

***Play video of promise lesson***
We kick off by taking a basic look at promises. This is because promises are fudamental to async await. However we don't add any noise by going deep into promises as a lot of the complex rules around `then` and `catch` callabacks are greatly simplified by using `async` `await`

***Play video of async await***
We then take a look at the async and await operators and how they simplify working with promises.

***Play video of execute promsies in parallel or serial***
Finally we look at a few additional patterns surrounding async await such as the default serial exection, parallel control flow using `Promise.all`, along with asynchrous iteration using for-await-of.

***Slide with course image***
I'm very excited about the code analysis and error checking offered by TypeScript when doing async / await and I hope you can see that with how fluently I can present this material. I can't wait to see what you build with this powerful and reliable combination of TypeScript with async/await.
